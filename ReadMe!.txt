Welcome to Apps32, the ultimate way for tech support! Apps32 is a remote access tool, in which you can view the persons screen, give it input such as mouse or keyboard, and the input will be processed on the other computer.  The purpose of this project was to make it easier to do tech support with people who have computer problems.  Simple have them run the server side, get their IP address, connect and you can do whatever.  Have you ever had a friend who needs tech support, but you can't leve work?  Apps32 makes it easy!

One command that isn't listedi is the [msg] command, which lets you send the user a message box.  Just Type [msg yourmessage] in the debug console.


IMPORTANT!  The server user MUST have the [jpgutils.dll] on their computer as well, in the system folder or the directory that the program is in.  THis dll is used to conver large bitmaps into smaller [JPEGS] so the screenshots download faster.

If you have any questions, comments, critisizing, advice, etc, let me know at [squeak5@mediaone.net] or [http://pagemac.cjb.net].
